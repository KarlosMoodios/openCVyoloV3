# opencvYOLOv3
A program using openCV-4.5.1 and a pretrained neural network-YOLOv3 created by Joseph Redmon.


If the program doesn't compile please check that your openCV version matches the one thats set up in the project.

If the version of openCV on your system is version 4.5.1 and it still doesn't compile, remove the settings in VC++ directories-> include and library section and the linker debug section, apply and okay it,
Then click build on the menu bar at the top of visual studio, and clean the build. Then re-setup the openCV VC++ directories and the linker. That should fix it.
